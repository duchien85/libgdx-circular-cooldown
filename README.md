# Examples of the LibGDX circular cooldown implementation

![LibGDX Circular Cooldown Examples](https://github.com/serhiy/libgdx-circular-cooldown/blob/master/circular-cooldown.png)

To run the application make sure you have Gradle plug-in integrated with your Eclipse (sorry I do not provide instructions to other IDEs) and you perform the following steps:
1. Click on "Run" menu
2. Select "Run configurations..." menu item
3. Double click the "Gradle project"
4. In "Gradle Tasks" field put the following command: `desktop:run`
5. In "Working Directory" field put the following entry `${workspace_loc:/libgdx-circular-cooldown}`
6. Click on "Run" button

Some of the code, which builds the segments for representing the circular cooldown has been taken from LibGDX ShapeRenderer.arc(...) implementation.

If you have a specific request or an idea for adding a new circular timer style contact me through contact form on the project Web-site.

TODO (ideas):
1. Make a circular progress bar with an image on top (clock for example).
